## Option 2 (recommended): Google form format

To download the checklist as **Google Forms** (recommended because it is more interactive and allows sending/sharing forms), follow the instructions below.

1. Sign into your Google Account
2. Click each of the links below to create a copy of the corresponding step in the Google form. Following the link will prompt you to make a copy in your own Google account.
3. If a menu item asks you to restore a folder (for storing responses), click “Yes”
4. After copying the form, you will be in "edit" mode. To *use* the form, send the form to yourself or whomever you'd like to fill it out.
